      <h1>Diversity, Background, & Cultures</h1>
      <p>Our origin stories begin all over the world. Each culture holds its own ideals and norms for the ways its
        citizens behave and communicate in different settings. Based on our unique backgrounds, our styles of
        communication have specific differences and led to interesting virtual interactions, where we all had to be
        mindful of the differences in communication etiquette. We saw these, many times subtle, differences throughout
        our virtual interactions. Added to this is the fact that many contributors in our group have temporarily lived
        in other countries as well, which diversifies their communication etiquette even further. The way we interact
        with others is supremely influenced by not only the area we are born but the regions we further develop through
        educational and work experiences.</p>

        <h5>United States - Communication Etiquette</h5>
        <p>Conversations often show their self-interest and this may come across as rude or aggressive. Typical
          conversations are more direct and simple language is valued. Non-verbal messages can be interpreted as
          confusing, so they are not as relied upon. Conversations are often also more personal in situations that may
          not call for that level of private directness.</p>

        <h5>Kenya - Communication Etiquette</h5>
        <p>Conversations are typically polite and friendly. These conversations follow a hierarchy where elders and
          superiors are respected and deferred to. Conversations are thought out in order to ensure respect and care is
          shown when interacting. Humor is often used when conversing.</p>

        <h5>Russia - Communication Etiquette</h5>
        <p>Conversations are more direct and matter-of-fact with corrections given immediately and honestly.
          Conversation is delivered in a more concise manner. This can sometimes be misinterpreted as being too blunt,
          but that is not the intent behind the direct delivery.</p>

        <h5>India - Communication Etiquette</h5>
        <p>Conversational norms are different based on relationship structure and hierarchy. Conversations do not
          usually include outright refusing an idea and remain more open. Non-verbal interactions are deeply intertwined
          with verbal conversations.</p>

        <h5>Finland - Communication Etiquette</h5>
        <p>Conversations are conducted in a respectful back and forth. Interrupting is considered rude and the listener
          is expected to let the speaker finish before contributing to the conversation. Voice tone remains moderate or
          neutral. Courtesy is shown to the speaker, which is an expectation that is common in all interactions.</p>
