# group2

This website is apart of a larger project created for a collaboration between Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).

The overall goals of this website is to highlight the globalization of technology and how connections can be easily created by networks of social media. Our project focuses on only four countries: Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Brazil. These countries were chosen given that the group members had some kind of connection with them through direct experiences or indirect experiences. 

Contributors to this project are: Axel Wills, Amy Martin, Gabriela Ticu, and Olivia MacIsaac.

Included in this GitHub repository are HTML, CSS, and JS.
