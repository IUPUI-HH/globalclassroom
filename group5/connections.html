            <h2>Connections</h2>
            <h3>Politeness</h3>
            <p>
               The definition of politeness is very different in American and Finnish culture.
               While it is polite to talk to and entertain people around you in the USA,
               that can be considered rude in Finland as you are expected to give the people around you their personal space.
            </p>
            <p>
               A shocking example of Finnish politeness is if for example when you see somebody trip and fall in public,
               you should not offer your help unless the person is in distress.
               It is best to ignore and not acknowledge the situation to spare the person of their embarrassment.
            </p>
            <h3>Anecdotes</h3>
            <p>
               Recently there was a Finnish newspaper article about a woman who likes to greet random strangers while walking
               outside.
               She wanted to see if this part of American culture could take hold in Finland. The reactions from strangers
               varied greatly.
               She reported that most people were taken aback by her greeting and many did not greet back or look her way.
            </p>
            <p>
               I have lived in my current apartment building for awhile now and I don't know who any of my neighbors are.
               I would not even recognize them on the street. Before I leave my apartments I listen if there are neighbors in
               the hallway. If so, I wait until they are gone before I leave the apartment.
               This is very common behavior here and I have heard of many people doing the same.
            </p>
            <h3>Similarities</h3>
            <p>
               American and Finnish culture are both western.
               So their way of thinking is not that different after all.
               Both countries are modern, both socially and technologically.
               Most Finnish people speak English very well so the language barrier is rarely the hurdle in communication
               between the two cultures.
            </p>
            <h3>Pieces of the same pie</h3>
            <p>
               But in the end, we are all just pieces of the same pie.
               Or as this <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathewguiver/which-type-of-bread-are-you" class="linkInMain" target="_blank"

            <p>The creators of this website on Intercultural Communication in a Global Classroom are a combination of two
               students from IUPUI in the United States and two students from Haaga-Helia in Finland. Though in different
               locations and different time zones, these students were able to communicate and collaborate their times to work
               together to create this website.
