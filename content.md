Global Classroom


Here is the official blurb from the website:
 https://global.iu.edu/education/internationalization/classroom/2021-sp-helling.html

Students in William Helling’s course, Information Structures for the Web, will partner with students at Haaga-Helia University in Helsinki, Finland. All students cover principles, methods, and techniques to develop web sites and digital services. This course emphasizes the work needed to create valid, accessible, and usable information displays for a global audience. Such effort requires development in both technical as well as conceptual skills. Information delivery today is most often through a screen of some sort, whether it be a desktop monitor, a tablet, a smartphone, or other device. Students need to know how users receive that information and what must be done to accommodate them. Native-English speakers and those who work in English as their second language will combine their insights in international communication. Through collaboration in a multi-cultural environment, students become aware of their own cultural bias and tendencies.


Details:
“Information Structures for the Web” (IUPUI) and “Orientation to Digital Services” (Haaga-Helia) came together in the Spring 2021 semester to collaborate in a Global Classroom initiative: https://global.iu.edu/education/internationalization/classroom/index.html

10 IUPUI students worked with 11 Haaga-Helia students. Nationalities included: Finland, Russia, Pakistan, Kenya, Nepal, South Africa, Germany, Chile, UK. HH students were added to the IUPUI Canvas course as students via their IU guest accounts where they see lectures and submit assignment just like the IUPUI students.

The first 6-7 weeks were spent on introductions, getting familiar with class tools, and studying basics of HTML and CSS. After this orientation, the students were divided into five groups, with a mixed representation of IUPUI + HH students. The last half of the semester these teams collaborated on their own group website. Each group had complete freedom for how they wanted to create their website, as long as it adhered to the technical standards for HTML, CSS, and accessibility. The website was required to be responsive and thus suitable for any device.

Students used these main tools to collaborate: Slack, GitHub, LinkedIn. Some groups used additional tools such as Discord and WhatsApp.

 However, each group was asked to react to a basic theme for this Global Classroom initiative:

Express Global Classroom student concerns: culture, background, assimilation, and diversity; features and commonalities that students share.

The five different groups developed these sites:

1.	“Culture Shock!” deals with the challenges that come from moving to a new, unfamiliar place. The goal is to help with the specifics of the “frustration/rejection” phase in which immigrants or visitors find themselves at odds with their new/temporary home.
2.	“Cross-Cultural Ties Through Social Media Platforms” explores the globalization of technology and how connections can be easily created by networks of social media. The project focuses on five countries: Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, and Brazil 
3.	“Best-G” highlights the challenges, as well as assets, of the Global collaborative classroom initiative. Here is shared the members’ diverse backgrounds, thoughts, and skills as a whole thus shedding light on a trend of globalization of the classroom experience.
4.	“Lock Down” provides reactions to how students in higher education have been impacted by the pandemic around the globe based on a brief survey of international articles.
5.	"Intercultural Communication in a Global Classroom" studies intercultural communication with a concentration on communicating with people who are culturally different, balancing working and studying while collaborating in an online global classroom.
