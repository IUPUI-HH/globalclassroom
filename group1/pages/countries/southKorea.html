              South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea) is a country on the
              southern part of the Korean peninsula, with its capital in Seoul.
              It is famous for its automobile and electronics production,
              ceramics, and is especially proud of its written system (Hangul).
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The weather in South Korea varies wildly, with cold winters, humid
              summers, and a monsoon season. Though most major metropolitan
              areas are designed with heavy rains in mind there are still yearly
              flood warnings. Much of South Korea is composed of mountains,
              valleys, and coastal plains.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The population of South Korea is relatively homogenous (over 97%
              ethnically Korean) and the official language is Korean (though
              English is commonplace, it is not universally
              taught/fluent/understood).

                to do. If you're looking for a bit of history and some good food
                then Gyeongbokgung Palace and the surrounding areas are a great
                place to start.

                you should try samgyupsal (grilled pork belly) or galbijjim

                I like and respect tradition as much as the next guy, but this
                has its limits. Traditions and cultural practices that

                women, the young, the old, the foreign, etc. — can/should/will

                South Korea has experienced phenomenal development since the end
                of the Korean War... so in roughly 70 years, it's gone from
                ~third-world impoverished nation to a highly modernized country
                that has seen tremendous economic growth and wealth creation. In
                four living generations, you span elderly people who experienced
                the Japanese colonial era, the ravages and deprivations of war,
                and the political chaos of the post-war years; middle-aged
                people who saw (and often were the agents of) major changes in
                society; to young people and children who have never known
                anything but post-scarcity peace and the internet. Worldviews,
                outlooks, attitudes, and motivations, uh, vary wildly.

            <h3>
              Genuine culture shock, i.e. required me to rearrange my thinking
              or behavior:
            </h3>

            <h3>Hierarchy</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Like most east Asian societies, Korea is hierarchical and modeled
              on the Confucian paradigm (Respect the elder. Love the young one.
              Thank you!). I was unprepared for just how pervasive and rigid the
              hierarchy was in Korean society though. Seniority is conferred
              through age, tenure, literal rank, grade level, and — in a
              modified form — wealth/social class (i.e. the wealthy have de
              facto leeway in ignoring the norms of hierarchy when it suits
              them). I was deeply surprised how I saw the hierarchical structure
              play out... from where/how colleagues sat at a business dinner, to
              how they poured drinks and ate (if you're low on the totem pole,
              you pour/receive drinks with both hands, then face away from the
              senior people so they don't even have to see your lowly ass
              drink), to even in a casual group of friends the younger people
              were usually a bit deferential to the older people. Beyond the
              social setting: older kids/students mercilessly bully their
              juniors, bosses at work are routinely shitheads to their
              employees, older siblings flex on younger siblings, coaches bully
              athletes (who in turn bully each other), and endless family drama
              stems from "position" (i.e. oldest sibling and his/her family vs.
              the younger or more distantly-related).
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              One added consequence is that everyone has a title. In families,
              in particular, all the kinship terms immediately identify gender,
              generation, age within a generation, and whether you've married
              in. When I first moved here, many of Emma's relatives insisted
              that [Emma’s cousins] refer to me as hyungbu (brother-in-law), and
              considered them to be disrespectful when they just called me by
              name. Imo and Imobu would always call me Smith-sobang (sobang
              denotes that I married into the family). It took a long time for
              them to all get used to calling me Larry, and I'm pretty sure they
              only do it because I'm a foreigner. If Jun Ho [Emma’s cousin’s
              husband] told everyone just to call him Jun Ho instead of
              Park-sobang, I don't think anyone would do it. Even now with some
              of the kids I tutor, I tell them (and their parents) that they can
              call me Larry or Lawrence, or whatever they are comfortable
              calling me. I've never once been called by name... it's always
              seonsaengnim (teacher), or in the case of one parent,
              Lawrence-ssaem (Lawrence-teacher).

            <h3>Misogyny</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The gender disparity in Korea is huge. Simply put, Korean society
              is still geared towards women being inferior, subservient, and
              amenable to decisions made by men. Korea still trails all OECD
              countries in gender wage gap (women earn roughly one-third less
              than men), and Korean women are generally expected to abandon
              their jobs once they get married. Though technically illegal,
              Korean employers routinely find ways to fire pregnant employees.
              While Korean men are expected to devote themselves to their jobs
              over their families, it is assumed that Korean women will pick up
              all the slack in terms of child-rearing and domestic life. That
              domestic life often includes subservience to her in-laws;
              daughters-in-law rank lowest in the family hierarchy, and can
              often be expected to cook and clean for their parents-in-law, and
              slave away in the kitchen non-stop for large family gatherings.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Korean matchmaking services often count advanced degrees and
              higher job positions against a woman's desirability; ideally, if a
              woman works at all, she would be a preschool teacher or something
              similar. Also, if she's over 25, she's practically over the hill.
              This is a country where it was illegal for women to smoke in
              public until the 1980s, and even now women smoking get the
              stinkeye from older people (and/or get yelled at) and are often
              stigmatized by men. This is a country where a male politician,
              during a hearing about declining national birth rates and
              population decline, chastised a female senior economist who was
              presenting about the issue that she was neglecting her duty to the
              country by not having kids. Granted, he got shit for it, but not
              much.

              How does this impact me? When we moved to Seoul, Emma had trouble
              finding a job (even at large, nominally-multinational companies)

              old, too strong-willed (foreign educated, lived abroad,
              communicates quite directly), and too likely to get pregnant and
              start a family (recently married, etc.) for any employer to want
              to deal with. All the HR practices that are illegal in the US,
              such as explicitly asking candidates about marital status, family
              planning, health condition, age, etc. as well as requiring a
              picture to be submitted with each resume, are par for the course
              here. In the meantime, Emma's female cousins (who are without fail
              the most interesting, capable, and educated members of Emma's
              family) routinely have to put up with all kinds of bullshit at
              work, including harassment, limited opportunities, lower pay, etc.
              It's getting better, particularly for Bella [Emma's cousin] since
              she works for a tech/gaming company with a more progressive
              culture, but there's still a long way to go. It's no accident that
              Emma's main source of employment is from a female-run company
              started by Emma's friend and her sister.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              In the meantime, most of Emma's friends (also largely
              highly-educated and progressive/open-minded) have confided that
              they are either unhappy with their jobs and/or their marriages.
              Korean norms are changing (slowly), but for the most part Korean
              society wants to put these women in situations/power dynamics/etc.
              that they don't want any part of. Both Emma and I are atypical by
              Korean standards, but we generally hear from Emma’s Korean friends
              — especially women — that they envy us for our marriage, our
              dynamic, the way we raise Ryan, etc. We hear it too often and from
              too many different people for it to be coincidence or flattery. Or
              as Emma’s mom told Imo the other day, "Ryan has two moms." I take
              that as a compliment.
            </p>

            <h3>Old People</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Old people here don't give a fuck. That is to say, they are
              ornery, outspoken, extremely set in their ways, and have
              substantial social clout. On the one hand, this makes them
              indistinguishable from old people the world over. But on the
              other, the way they go about not giving a fuck is uniquely Korean.
              Old men will smoke wherever they please; they will ride their
              mobility scooters at 1 kph through traffic; they will sit all day
              with their friends on the furniture displays in Emart [a retail
              store roughly equivalent to a Target]. God have mercy on you if
              you're the young person or employee tasked with telling them to
              stop what they're doing.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              In particular, Korean ajummas are amazing. Women of a certain age
              — usually empty-nesters, sometimes widowed, sometimes not, old but
              not exactly elderly — morph into this crazy force of nature. They
              are everything old men are, but to the nth degree. They are
              fearless and uniquely powerful. They will talk shit to anyone,
              they will break up fights (and then lecture the erstwhile
              fighters), they will bend anyone's rules by the power of their
              stubbornness, and they will shock and delight you with their
              directness and humor. They are almost a third gender, as they are
              (at times) unconstrained by Korean norms and expectations of men
              and women.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Perhaps as a holdover from post-war scarcity, and perhaps as an
              extension of long-established Korean food culture, you will see
              legions of ajummas foraging for wild seasonal greens and mushrooms
              throughout the year. They gather mugwort in the spring from parks,
              hillsides, mountain preserves, road medians, and riverbanks. Yes,
              mugwort soup tastes good, but I feel like the compulsion to forage
              comes from a living collective memory of deprivation. This extends
              to other aspects of Korean food culture... yeah sure, make a fish
              stew with the boniest, most difficult to eat fish... eat all the
              tripe and pork belly you want... but it's a historical fact that
              most of the "good" cuts of meat and fish were exported for sale in
              post-war years. Korean food, as with old people, exists with an
              attitude of getting by with less.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Not culture shock, per se, but still requiring an adjustment
              period:
            </h3>

            <h3>Personal space and public interactions</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              When I lived in NYC, there was a logical, generally predictable
              flow to the way pedestrians moved, even in very crowded or busy
              places. People would position themselves or move with the
              knowledge that others were trying to walk, find a seat on the
              train, get through a door, etc. and (sort of) try not to impede
              the flow. No such awareness, anticipation, or regard exists here.
              People stand in each others' way all the time, barely get out of
              each others' path when walking, push their shopping carts into
              impossible gridlock, and generally drive me fucking crazy.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The thing is, none of this bugs Koreans (beyond baseline
              aggravation). This is just normal and unsurprising, and an
              extension of the Korean attitude towards strangers in public...
              namely, no one gives even the most basic shit about anyone else.
              All the tiny courtesies we experience in the US, such as people
              holding a door open if you're walking into a building behind them,
              or saying "excuse me" if you bump into someone on a crowded train
              platform, or even a little nod of acknowledgment when someone
              gestures for you to go first.... they don't exist here.
            </p>

            <h3>Shitty driving</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              This is a direct extension to my public interaction gripe above.
              People drive with little regard for anyone but themselves, and
              with almost none of the sense of anticipation (or attitude that
              their own driving should be predictable) that informs US notions
              of "defensive driving."
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              I've traveled to a lot of places where the driving culture has
              surrendered to a kind of controlled chaos... Thailand, Vietnam,
              Indonesia, Italy... and the craziness has never bothered me. The
              thing that gets me about Korea is that the road design and modern
              cars have all the trappings of safe, responsible driving. There
              are clear signals and school zones and cameras everywhere, and yet
              people drive with a willful shittiness that I can't explain. It
              goes beyond just driving aggressively or impatiently (though there
              is plenty of that). I am tempted to say it's a holdover from
              Korea's dramatic expansion of personal wealth from the 1970s
              through the 90s... during this period, the number of cars on the
              road exploded, and with the ability to drive (and an
              infrastructure that barely kept up) came an entitlement to do
              whatever the hell you wanted. It's no coincidence that South Korea
              had the highest per capita road deaths of OECD countries for most
              of the 1980s and 90s.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Anyways, I think it's the shitty driving in the context of a
              driving environment that maintains the pretense of good driving
              that gets to me.
            </p>

            <h3>Indirect communication</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              No one tells it like it is, particularly for bad news or
              "constructive" criticism. Unless the power dynamic and the nature
              of the news absolutely favors the speaker — i.e. the speaker will
              experience no embarrassment, judgment, or social risk — then no
              one will speak plainly. But outside of this scenario, no one will
              criticize their social superiors or acknowledge uncomfortable
              truths about themselves. There is very little idea that you can
              speak truth to power; if one does, then there are two usual
              outcomes: 1) the speaker is ignored, or 2) people kill the
              messenger.
