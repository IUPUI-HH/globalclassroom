              The great difficulty of describing America (or "The
              States") is that there is no single culture of Americans; you can
              describe the constitution, the courts, popular culture movements,
              the education system, but there will always be some other
              unexpected layer of America to explore.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              America is a series of complex descriptors that vary from the
              geographical to the political, from the occupational to the
              musical. It's tough to know what the "normal" thing is in America
              (at least in the big cities) but that also makes it a little
              easier: with so many different cultures you're bound to find an
              interesting one.

              <p class="questionAnswer">
                The United States uses a system of measurement based on the
                English Units used during the British Empire.

                However, it depends on where you are staying. In a city, you
                will hear many different languages spoken where as in a rural
                town, you may hear one to two different languages.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              America is definitely not a mono-culture; it can be overwhelming
              to adjust to not just one culture, but potentially hundreds as you
              encounter many immigrants and even natives with wildly differing
              opinions on what is “normal”.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              There are also 4 time zones in the contiguous United States, which
              can make cross-country collaboration tricky if you don’t account
              for it.
            </p>

            <h3>Households</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              It’s not a universal custom to remove shoes when visiting
              someone’s house in America; make sure to check in with your host,
              as removing shoes or keeping them on when entering can be equally
              as embarrassing.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Front lawns and grass are common in the US, especially in suburban
              areas. A common stereotype is an old guy yelling “get off my
              lawn!”
            </p>

            <h3>Child Supervision</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              It’s generally expected that anyone under the age of 16 (and
              definitely primary school-aged children) will be supervised; it is
              very uncommon to see children out by themselves without a parent
              unless waiting at a bus stop or near a house.
            </p>

            <h3>Electronics</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The United States uses 110 -120 volt plugs. You might need an
              adapter!
            </p>

            <h3>Paying for Things</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              While cash is still used it is becoming less common; many
              electronic payment methods, however, come with extra charges to be
              wary of.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Many services have “hidden” fees or unexpected charges. If an
              itemized bill is available, check it over!
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Most businesses do not include taxes on price tags or signs, and
              most states have a sales tax that is only applied once you’re at
              checkout.
            </p>

            <h3>Restaurants</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              America has a funny relationship with customer service; Americans
              generally expect above and beyond service from their wait staff,
              and it’s usually expected that customers tip (even if you
              considered the service “bad”).
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Food portions are generally large, especially at diner-style
              restaurants.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Visitors often remark on the sugar content of American food;
              things that are sugary are <em>more</em> sugary, and some things
              that are not sugary in other countries are sweet (bread, for
              example).
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              American foods are often high in animal protein and carbohydrates
              (burgers are probably the most American food out there, and
              vegetables are often optional on a cheeseburger).
            </p>

            <h3>Getting around</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Public transportation will vary widely in terms of availability
              and quality; large metropolitan areas will usually have good
              coverage, but this is not universal (Los Angeles, for example, is
              getting <em>better</em> but is not yet <em>good</em> in terms of
              its transportation network). Some areas are almost impossible to
              navigate without a car or some kind of ride-share.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Bicycles are possible, but with a pervasive car culture, it can be
              something of a gamble as far as safety is concerned. The
              availability of bike lanes and bike racks will vary across cities
              and businesses.
            </p>

            <h3>Police and Gun Culture</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              American Police almost universally carry guns; this can be
              shocking for people from the UK, for example, where armed police
              are a rarity.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              There are parts of the United States where it’s legal to carry a
              rifle or handgun as long as it’s visible to the public; though
              rare, it’s not impossible to see armed civilians in shopping
              areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Subcultures and Tattoos</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              There are many subcultures in the US, and it’s not always clear to
              outsiders which ones are dangerous; tattoos, heavy facial
              piercings, and dyed/colored hair are not signs of criminality or
              delinquency by default. Punk, Goth, Cottagecore, Streetwear, or
              any number of other fashion/lifestyle trends are seen as “normal”
              or at least “non-threatening” (although some would disagree with
              that about “Cottagecore”).
