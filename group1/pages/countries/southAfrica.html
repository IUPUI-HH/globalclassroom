              The Republic of South Africa, colloquially known as South Africa,
              SA or RSA, was officially brought into the world between 1994 and
              1996, after the dismantlement of the Apartheid regime. More

              South Africa is made up of 9 provinces and each has its own
              history, landscape, population, languages, economy, and
              government. Each province can also said to be distinct in its
              geography. South Africa is the southernmost country in Africa and
              covers an area of 1.2 million square kilometers (471 thousand
              square miles). Stretching across the entire bottom of Africa, from
              the Atlantic Ocean on the West Coast to the Indian Ocean on the
              East Coast. With such a large landmass and with the differences
              between ocean currents, the geography of South Africa is diverse,
              and no two provinces have the same geographical or biological
              makeup.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              South Africa has 11 official languages; English, isiZulu,
              isiXhosa, Afrikaans, Sepedi, Setswana, Sesotho, Xitsonga, siSwati,
              Tshivenda, and isiNdebele. Each province in South Africa has its
              own official languages, generally two to three of the national
              languages. There are a few non-national languages, as the official
              languages in South Africa showcase the major ethnic groups in
              South Africa.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The natural wildlife of South Africa is a major draw for many
              tourists and plays a major part in every South Africans daily
              life, from African elephants to Great White Sharks, South Africa
              has magnificently diverse wildlife - and is perfect for nature
              lovers.

              South Africa has a rich history, but its' true worth is in its'

                Depends on what you want! The varied provinces and geography
                that make up South Africa mean that you can pretty much pick and
                choose what you want. If you want warm water, swimming all day
                and warm weather head near Durban. If you love wine, cool
                weather and surfing head to Cape Town area. And if you're
                looking for a glamourous, city life head to Johannesburg. But
                there are so many cities and so many differences between them
                all that it is all up to you.

                TSouth Africa has a high unemployment rate, but at the same time

                are a hot commodity. Tech, medicine, anything financial related

              South Africans are known for being warm and welcoming people, easy
              to make friends with, and happy to just take a 'chill and braai'.
              The best way to get to know South Africans is through a 'braai'. A
              braai is a South African slang term for a barbeque, however, it
              involves a lot more than just having a barbeque with friends. A
              braai is a social event, including sitting in front of either an
              open wood fire or Weber, drinking, and enjoying your friend's
              company. Braaing is an everyday occurrence in South Africa, and be
              prepared to be invited to one every weekend. Bring some drinks,
              meat and a side dish such as potato salad, garlic bread or salad.
              The key thing to remember is that everyone shares - you will all
              dish up once the meat has been cooked and everyone will have
              pieces of each other's food. Except if you bring fancy meat - in
              which case you will have first pick of your meat and then it's a
              free-for-all.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <h3>Tipping Culture</h3>

              <li>
                Tips are normally 10% of the bill and have to be added to the
                bill. You need to write the amount down, and the total amount on
                the spaces provided.
              </li>
              <li>
                Car guards (people who look after your cars in the parking lots)
                should get between R2 and R10, depending on various factors
                including how helpful they were (they often help you take your
                groceries to your car or find you a parking spot) as well as how
                generous you feel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gas/Petrol attendants also get tipped. In SA you are not allowed
                to put in your own gas/petrol, and you must pull into a petrol
                station and wait for someone to help you. Once you are done, you
                generally give R5 to R10 as tips - again depending on how
                helpful the attendant was, whether they were fast, did they
                clean your windows etc.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              South Africans are mad about their food - the food you'll find is
              varied and every province and sometimes even every city has their
              "speciality". Try them all out! Gatsbys, bunny chow, milktart,
              biltong and koeksisters are some of the best and most traditional
              South African foods you can get.
            </p>
            <h3>Bonding with South Africans</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              A rather weird way South Africans like to bond is either through
              complaining or poking fun at each other. Complaining is about
              essentially everything and not done in a way that they expect
              something to be done about it - more just as a conversation about
              how terrible everything is. Poking fun is also known as "tuning"
              or "to tune" someone or "dissing" or "to diss" someone. Don't take
              this tuning to heart - its meant in an affectionate way.
            </p>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Carrying on with the strange slang you'll find in South Africa -
              there are strange ways that South Africans like to express
              themselves. Most of the words and a lot of the common phrases the
              South Africans use are not found anywhere else in the world -
              which can be rather confusing for the unaware.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <h3>The Strange Slang Words</h3>
              <li>
                Now / Now now / Just now / In a bit - seems like a pretty simple
                thing right? Unfortunately, South Africans like to make it hard
                for you. These phrases mean completely different things - and
                can also be completely different depending on the person. Now
                means something will be done within the next week, whereas in a
                bit or just now can mean it will be done almost immediately.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lekker / Nice - lekker is an Afrikaans word meaning "nice" or
                "good". It is used in almost any setting when you want to
                express that something is good.
              </li>
              <li>
                Shame - used by South Africans almost all the time. Often used
                when describing something cute or pretty or simply used as a
                filler word.
              </li>
              <li>
                Holding thumbs - means the same as crossing your fingers.
                Essentially hoping for a good outcome.
              </li>
              <li>
                Kuier - another Afrikaans word that has been adopted throughout
                the country. It means to have a truly good time out with
                friends, often drinking or having a braai.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ag man - meaning "oh man" and can be used in any setting
                essentially, just dependant on the way you use it. It can be
                used as an exclamation of surprise or as oh thats nice or sweet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ja, no / Yea, no / Ja, nee - a nonsensical filler that South
                Africans often use at the beginning of sentences.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Crime</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Now as much as it sucks, there is a lot of crime in South Africa
              and as such you need to be prepared. Some basic tips are outlined
              below but the most important thing is to always be vigilant. Don't
              let your guard down, watch the people around you and don't let
              people see you have money.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Keep your cellphone and wallet out of your hands except for when
                you are actively using them. Do NOT use them in the centre of
                town, at the traffic lights (affectionally called robots in
                South Africa) or while driving.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you stop at your home, make sure you get out of your car
                and into the house quickly. Don't let yourself be a sitting duck
                in the driveway or as the gate to your property opens.

                Security around your house is a must - at the very least spiked
                fences, electric gates and home security system that is run by a
                security company. You can go more advanced and add electric
                fences to the top of your walls, but that depends on where you
                live. Take a note out of your neighbours' books and look at
                their security measures.

                Do not walk alone at night or at dusk/dawn. Preferably don't
                walk anywhere except malls alone.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't leave valuables where other people can see it. Keep
                valuables away from windows, and move everything into the boot
                of your car or stash it under the seat so no one can see it.
