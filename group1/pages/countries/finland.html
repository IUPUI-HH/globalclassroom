              and the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea across Estonia to the

              Finns are interesting people. They are know throughout the world
              as being shy and hard to get to know, and this is very true.
              However, what everyone forgets to mention is that once you have
              made friends with a Finn it is for life. Making friends here is
              hard, especially because you tend to have to put in the work in.
              Inviting your Finnish friends out for drinks and picnics,
              exploring the city and asking them to show you the Finnish
              traditions are great ways to get to know Finns. Unfortunately you
              will probably have to be the one to ask your Finnish friend to do
              these things, at least in the beginning. Once you have broken that
              barrier and become part of their group - you will be invited to
              everything.
            </p>
            <h3>Summer life</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Finns love summer, and love enjoying a whole afternoon drinking,
              eating and chatting at a restaurant terrace. Most restaurants have
              a summer terrace where you can sit at very cosy chairs, often
              beanbags or lounge chairs and just enjoy your afternoon. Another
              common summer activity is heading to your "mokki". A mokki is a
              Finnish summer cottage, often not connected to electricity and
              with a compost toilet and found on the edge of a lake. Finns head
              there for pretty much the entirety of summer, and if you are part
              of the friend group you will likely be invited to go there too.
            </p>
            <h3>Cuisine</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              The traditional cuisine in Finland is very ... interesting? Mixing
              sausages and milk, adding jam to pretty much everything, rice
              cakes and tons of doughnuts as well as pastries stuffed with
              almond extracts! Test them out, some people love them but it isn't
              for everyone! If you ask your Finnish friends or co-workers they
              will probably direct you to their favourite cafe, and it is a nice
              ice breaker to get to know them.
            </p>
            <h3>Coffee</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Coffee is probably one of the most important parts of being a
              Finn. Finns adore coffee, they go out for coffee at all times of
              the day - and are known for drinking the most amount of coffee per
              capita. The best way to start getting to know Finns is through
              coffee. Ask to go to a cafe and be prepared to spend the next few
              hours aimlessly chatting about everything. Filter coffee is
              scared, so be prepared to have filter coffee available to your
              Finnish guests, and try to have different flavours as that will
              really "wow" them.
            </p>

            <h3>The language</h3>
            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              Finnish is an incredibly hard language to learn. There is no way
              around it, unfortunately. <br />
              Luckily most Finns speak English incredibly well, so you should be
              perfectly fine while you learn the language. Finns are also pretty
              helpful - especially if you just tell them you are still learning
              Finnish, they will often help you out and tell you the sentence or
              word(s) you are looking for! Swedish is the other national
              language of Finland, and is a lot easier to read and understand if
              you already speak other Germanic languages - so it may be worth
              learning how to at least read basic signs in Swedish in order to
              get around, in the beginning anyway! <br />
              There is one word you definitely need to know though - "No niin".
              This is a filler group essentially, you can use it for anything
              and it means pretty much everything.
